# Github Repository Image Badge
PHP-script which creates an image similar to the output of the [https://github.com/heipei/github-commit-badge](github-commit-badge). Usefull to integrate in forums etc., where JavaScript or even plain HTML is not allowed.

## Example
http://dev.tiefpunkt.com/github-img-badge/badge.php?user=tiefpunkt&repo=github-img-badge    

## Inspiration
* Fonts: [http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page](DejaVu-Fonts)
* Small Images + Layout: [https://github.com/heipei/github-commit-badge](github-commit-badge)
* Github-API-Connector: [https://github.com/ornicar/php-github-api](php-github-api)

## Disclaimer
This badge has been a "remember-how-to-write-php"-kind of project, thus the code is anything but pretty, and probably buggy as hell. Use at your own risk!
